# OpenGuardrails AI Runtime Security Management System (AI-RSMS)

**International Standard**

## Foreword

This document was prepared by the OpenGuardrails community.

AI systems and large language models introduce new classes of runtime risks that are not fully
addressed by traditional information security management systems. This International Standard
defines a runtime-centric management system to govern, enforce, and audit AI behavior in
enterprise environments.

## Introduction

This International Standard specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining,
and continually improving an **AI Runtime Security Management System (AI-RSMS)**.

The AI-RSMS enables organizations to operationalize AI governance, policy enforcement, and
regulatory compliance directly within the runtime operation of AI systems, including prompts,
models, agents, tools, and outputs.

This document is intended to be compatible with ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27701,
the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, and related frameworks.

# Scope

This International Standard applies to organizations that design, develop, deploy, operate,
or manage:

- AI applications (e.g. chatbots, copilots, RAG systems);
- AI agents with autonomous or semi-autonomous behavior;
- AI model services provided internally or by third parties.

The scope includes AI behavior during runtime, including prompts, retrieved context,
inference, tool invocation, and outputs.
