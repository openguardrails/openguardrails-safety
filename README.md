> **The only production-ready, fully open-source AI guardrails platform for enterprise data protection**

**OpenGuardrails** is an **open-source AI security gateway** that prevents enterprise AI applications from leaking sensitive data to external LLM providers — **without disrupting user workflows**.

## The Enterprise AI Data Leakage Problem

When employees use AI applications (Copilot, ChatGPT, internal AI agents), sensitive enterprise data flows to external LLM providers:

- **PII**: Employee emails, customer phone numbers, government IDs
- **Credentials**: API keys, database passwords, access tokens in code
- **Confidentials**: Trade secrets, internal project names, financial data

**The challenge**: Blocking these requests breaks user workflows. Allowing them creates compliance and security risks.

**OpenGuardrails solves this** with intelligent data protection that keeps AI applications usable while keeping sensitive data secure.

---

## How It Works

OpenGuardrails acts as an AI Gateway between your AI applications and LLM providers, automatically detecting and protecting sensitive data:

    <img src="frontend/public/arch.png" width="800"/>
</p>

### Strategy 1: Mask & Restore (Anonymization)

Sensitive data is masked before sending to external LLMs, then restored in the response — users see correct results, but external providers never see real data.

<p align="center">
    <img src="frontend/public/seqflow_mask_restore.png" width="800"/>
</p>

**Flow:**
1. User request contains sensitive data (e.g., `thomas@openguardrails.com`)
2. Gateway detects and masks: `__email_1__@openguardrails.com`
3. Sanitized request sent to external LLM
4. Response received with masked placeholders
5. Original values restored before returning to user

### Strategy 2: Private Model Routing

For high-risk data, requests are automatically routed to your private/on-premise LLM — the original data never leaves your infrastructure.

    <img src="frontend/public/seqflow_swich_private_model.png" width="800"/>
</p>

**Flow:**
1. User request contains high-risk sensitive data
2. Gateway classifies risk level and applies policy
3. Request routed to private LLM (with original data intact)
4. Response returned to user seamlessly

**Users experience zero disruption** — they don't know their request was rerouted for security.

## AI-Powered Sensitive Data Recognition

Unlike rule-based DLP systems, OpenGuardrails uses **GenAI-powered recognition** to detect sensitive data that regex patterns miss:

### Natural Language Anonymization

Detects sensitive information expressed in natural language:

| Input | Detection |
|-------|-----------|
| "My employee ID is 12345" | `employee_id` detected |
| "Contact John at his personal cell" | `phone_number` context detected |
| "The Q3 revenue was $2.5M" | `financial_data` detected |
| "Our AWS secret key starts with AKIA..." | `cloud_credential` detected |

### Code Logic Anonymization

Detects credentials and secrets embedded in code:

```python
# Input code snippet
db_password = "super_secret_123"
api_key = "sk-proj-abc123..."
conn_string = "postgresql://admin:password@internal-db:5432"
```

All three sensitive values are detected and masked, even without explicit patterns.

### Recognition Methods

| Method | Best For | Examples |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **GenAI Recognition** | Context-dependent, natural language | Trade secrets, business confidentials, implicit references |
| **Regex Patterns** | Structured data with known formats | Credit cards, SSN, phone numbers, emails |
| **Custom Keywords** | Organization-specific terms | Project codenames, internal system names |

---

## Policy-Based Data Classification

Define what's sensitive **according to your organization's policy**, not just generic PII:

```yaml
# Example: Enterprise Data Classification Policy
high_risk:
  - customer_pii
  - financial_records
  - source_code
  - api_credentials
  action: switch_private_model

medium_risk:
  - employee_emails
  - internal_project_names
  action: anonymize

low_risk:
  - general_business_info
  action: anonymize
```

**Configurable actions per risk level:**
- `block` — Reject the request entirely
- `switch_private_model` — Route to on-premise LLM
- `anonymize` — Mask and restore sensitive data
- `pass` — Allow with audit logging

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Try Online (Fastest)

https://www.openguardrails.com/platform/

### Option 2: Python SDK

```bash
pip install openguardrails
```

```python
from openguardrails import OpenGuardrails

client = OpenGuardrails("your-api-key")
result = client.check_prompt("Send report to john@company.com with Q3 revenue $2.5M")

print(result.detected_entities)
# [{"type": "email", "value": "john@company.com"},
#  {"type": "financial_data", "value": "$2.5M"}]
print(result.suggest_action)  # anonymize
```

### Option 3: OpenAI-Compatible Gateway (Zero Code Change)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Just change the base_url — all other code stays the same
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:5002/v1",
    api_key="sk-xxai-your-key"
)

# Automatic data protection — no code changes needed!
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the contract for Acme Corp deal #12345"}]
)
# Sensitive data automatically masked/routed based on your policy
```

## Enterprise Deployment

OpenGuardrails is designed for **air-gapped and regulated environments**:

- **Fully on-premise** — No data leaves your infrastructure
- **Private cloud ready** — Deploy on AWS, Azure, GCP VPC
- **Compliance friendly** — SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR compatible architecture
- **High performance** — <50ms latency overhead, 1000+ req/sec

### Deployment Options

```bash
# Quick start with Docker
docker compose up -d

# Production deployment
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openguardrails/openguardrails/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Integration Points

- **API Gateway** — Nginx, Kong, AWS API Gateway
- **AI Platforms** — Dify, n8n, LangChain, LlamaIndex
- **Direct Integration** — SDK for Python, REST API

See [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.
