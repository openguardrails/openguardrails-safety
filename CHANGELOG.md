### 🛡️ Self-Service False Positive Appeal System

This release introduces a comprehensive **Self-Service False Positive Appeal System** that enables end users to appeal when they believe their requests have been incorrectly flagged as high-risk content. The system supports both AI-powered auto-review and manual human review workflows, significantly reducing false positive impact on legitimate user workflows.

#### 🎯 What's New

**Problem Solved**: Online guardrails systems inevitably produce false positives, which can disrupt legitimate user workflows. Traditional approaches require platform administrators to manually review these cases, creating bottlenecks and poor user experience.

**Solution**: A self-service appeal system that:
- ✅ **User-Friendly**: End users can easily submit appeals with a clicking an appeal link
- ✅ **AI-Powered Review**: Automatic AI review for quick resolution of genuine false positives
- ✅ **Human Fallback**: Manual review capabilities for complex or ambiguous cases
- ✅ **Flexible Configuration**: Per-application appeal settings with custom messages
- ✅ **Complete Audit Trail**: Full history of appeals, reviews, and decisions

#### Added

##### 🔔 **Appeal Configuration Management**

**Per-Application Configuration**:
- `enabled`: Enable/disable appeal feature per application
- `message_template`: Custom appeal message with `{appeal_url}` placeholder
- `appeal_base_url`: Base URL for appeal links (public-facing domain)
- `final_reviewer_email`: Email for human review notifications when AI rejects appeal

**Appeal Flow**:
```
1. User request blocked by guardrails
2. System returns response with appeal URL link
3. User clicks link → Opens self-service appeal page
4. User submits appeal with optional reason
5. AI auto-reviews appeal → Approve/Reject
6. If AI unsure → Escalate to human reviewer
7. Human approves/rejects → User notified
8. Auto-lift ban if appeal approved (for banned users)
```

##### 🤖 **AI-Powered Appeal Review**

The system uses AI to automatically evaluate appeal requests:

**AI Review Process**:
- Analyzes original content against risk categories
- Evaluates user-provided reason for appeal
- Makes approve/reject decision with confidence score
- Provides detailed explanation for decision

**Review Outcomes**:
- `approved`: Appeal accepted, ban lifted or content allowed
- `rejected`: Appeal denied, original decision upheld
- `pending_review`: AI uncertain, escalate to human reviewer

**Statistics Tracking**:
- AI approval rate: Track how often AI approves appeals
- Review accuracy: Validate AI decisions against human reviews
- Processing time: Measure AI review performance

##### 👤 **User-Friendly Appeal Interface**

**End-User Appeal Page** (`/appeal/{request_id}`):
- Display original blocked content and risk level
- Show matched risk categories
- Provide appeal reason input (optional)
- Submit appeal with one click
- View appeal status in real-time

**Appeal Status Flow**:
1. `pending` → Initial state, awaiting review
2. `reviewing` → AI is currently reviewing
3. `pending_review` → Escalated to human reviewer
4. `approved` → Appeal accepted
5. `rejected` → Appeal denied

##### 📊 **Admin Appeal Management**

**Appeal Management Dashboard** (`/platform/config/appeal`):
- View all appeals for current application
- Filter by status (pending, reviewing, pending_review, approved, rejected)
- Paginated list with detailed information
- Manual review capabilities for human reviewers
- Export appeals to Excel for compliance auditing

**Manual Review Actions**:
- **Approve Appeal**: Override AI decision, approve the appeal
- **Reject Appeal**: Confirm AI decision, reject the appeal
- **Add Reason**: Record rationale for manual review decisions

##### 🗂️ **Database Schema**

**New Table: `appeal_config`**
- Stores per-application appeal configuration
- `id`, `application_id`, `tenant_id`
- `enabled`, `message_template`, `appeal_base_url`, `final_reviewer_email`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

**New Table: `appeal_records`**
- Stores all appeal submissions and reviews
- `id`, `request_id`, `application_id`, `tenant_id`, `user_id`
- `original_content`, `original_risk_level`, `original_categories`
- `status`, `ai_approved`, `ai_review_result`
- `ai_reviewed_at`, `processed_at`
- `processor_type`, `processor_id`, `processor_reason`
- `created_at`

##### 🌐 **New API Endpoints**

**Appeal Configuration** (Admin API - Port 5000):
```bash
GET  /api/v1/config/appeal              # Get appeal config
PUT  /api/v1/config/appeal              # Update appeal config
```

**Appeal Records** (Admin API - Port 5000):
```bash

POST /api/v1/config/appeal/records/{id}/review  # Manual review
GET  /api/v1/config/appeal/records/export  # Export to Excel
```

**Appeal Submission** (Detection API - Port 5001):
```bash
GET  /v1/appeal/{request_id}            # Get appeal details (public link)
POST /v1/appeal/{request_id}            # Submit appeal
GET  /v1/appeal/{request_id}/status     # Check appeal status (polling)
```

##### 🔄 **Integration with Existing Systems**

**Detection Service Integration**:
- When request is blocked, check if appeal is enabled for application
- If enabled, generate appeal URL and include in response
- Store appeal request ID in detection results

**Ban Policy Integration**:
- If appeal is approved, auto-lift ban (if user was banned)
- Update banned users table with appeal resolution status
- Revoke pending ban timers for appealed users

**Proxy Service Integration**:
- Pass appeal URL through proxy responses
- Maintain consistent appeal experience across API and Gateway modes

##### 🌍 **Internationalization**

**Added Translations**:
- Complete English and Chinese translations for appeal system
- Appeal status messages (pending, reviewing, approved, rejected)
- UI labels and help text
- Error messages and notifications

#### Changed

##### 📝 **Detection Response Format**

**Enhanced Response with Appeal Link**:
```json
{
  "is_blocked": true,
  "risk_level": "high",
  "categories": ["S5", "S9"],
  "suggest_answer": "...",
  "appeal_url": "https://your-domain.com/appeal/{request_id}",
  "appeal_message": ""
}
```

**Backward Compatible**: Fields only added when appeal is enabled for application.

##### 🤖 **AI Model Integration**

Appeal review uses the existing OpenGuardrails-Text model for intelligent content analysis:
- Leverages same risk categories (S1-S21) as detection
- Consistent risk assessment across detection and appeal
- No additional infrastructure required

#### Documentation

**New UI Pages**:
- `/platform/config/appeal` - Admin appeal management dashboard
- `/appeal/{request_id}` - Public self-service appeal page

**Updated Backend Services**:
- `backend/services/appeal_service.py` - Appeal business logic
- `backend/routers/appeal_api.py` - Admin appeal configuration API
- `backend/routers/appeal_router.py` - Detection API appeal routes

**Frontend Components**:
- `frontend/src/pages/AccessControl/FalsePositiveAppeal.tsx` - Public appeal page
- `frontend/src/pages/AccessControl/AppealManagement.tsx` - Admin dashboard
- Updated API service with appeal endpoints
- Updated i18n files (en.json, zh.json)

#### Usage Example

**End-User Appeal Flow**:

1. User sends request that gets blocked:
```python
client.check_prompt("Normal business inquiry that was falsely flagged")
# Response: is_blocked=True with appeal_url
```

2. User receives response with appeal link:
```
您的请求被拦截，原因：高风险内容
申诉链接: https://your-domain.com/appeal/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

3. User clicks link, sees appeal page, submits appeal
4. System auto-reviews using AI, approves appeal
5. User retry the original request - now allowed

**Admin Manual Review**:

```python
import requests

# View pending appeals
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/config/appeal/records?status=pending_review",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-jwt-token"}
)

# Manually approve appeal
requests.post(
    f"http://localhost:5000/api/v1/config/appeal/records/{appeal_id}/review",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-jwt-token"},
    json={
        "action": "approve",
        "reason": "Reviewed content manually - legitimate business use case"
    }
)
```

#### Configuration

**Enable Appeal for Application**:

```bash
# Update appeal config
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/config/appeal" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enabled": true,
    "message_template": "If you think this is a false positive, please click the following link to appeal: {appeal_url}",
    "appeal_base_url": "https://your-public-domain.com",
    "final_reviewer_email": "reviewer@yourcompany.com"
  }'
```

**Environment Variables**:
No new environment variables required. Appeal configuration is per-application via Admin UI.

#### Security & Privacy

- **Public appeal pages require request ID**: Only users who received a blocked response can appeal
- **No user authentication required**: Encourages users to submit appeals without friction
- **Limited information exposure**: Appeal page shows only blocked content, not user-identifiable data
- **Permission controls**: Manual review APIs require Admin authentication
- **Audit trail**: All appeals and reviews permanently logged for compliance

#### Performance

- **Appeal submission**: < 100ms overhead on existing detection flow
- **AI review**: Typically < 500ms (uses existing OpenGuardrails-Text model)
- **Database queries**: Indexed on request_id for fast lookups
- **No impact on detection**: Appeal system only activated when request is blocked

#### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements in future releases:
- Email notifications for appeal status updates
- Appeal statistics and trends dashboard
- Bulk appeal approval/rejection tools
- Custom AI review prompts per application
- Appeal rate limiting (prevent abuse)
- Multi-tenant appeal review visibility

## [5.1.0] - 2026-01-06

### 🚀 Major Update: Automatic Private Model Switching for Enterprise Data Protection

This release introduces **Automatic Private Model Switching** — a major enhancement to the Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) system that enables enterprise AI agents to seamlessly protect sensitive data **without affecting user experience**.

#### 🎯 Key Value Proposition

**Problem Solved**: Enterprise AI applications often face a dilemma between data security and user experience. Blocking requests with sensitive data disrupts workflows, while allowing them risks data leakage to external AI providers.

**Solution**: Automatic Private Model Switching intelligently routes requests containing sensitive data to private/on-premise models, ensuring:
- ✅ **Zero User Disruption**: Users continue their workflow seamlessly
- ✅ **Complete Data Protection**: Sensitive data never leaves your infrastructure
- ✅ **Transparent Operation**: Switching happens automatically without user intervention
- ✅ **Flexible Policies**: Configure different actions for different risk levels

#### 🆕 What's New

##### 🔄 **Automatic Private Model Switching**

When sensitive data is detected, the system can automatically redirect requests to a designated private model instead of blocking or anonymizing:

**How It Works**:
```
1. User sends request to AI agent
2. DLP system detects sensitive entities (PII, financial data, etc.)
3. Based on configured risk level action:
   - High Risk → Block (default) or Switch to Private Model
   - Medium Risk → Switch to Private Model (default)
   - Low Risk → Anonymize (default) or Pass
4. If action is "switch_private_model":
   - Request is transparently routed to configured private model
   - User receives response normally, unaware of the switch
   - Sensitive data stays within your infrastructure
```

**Enterprise Benefits**:
- **For AI Agents**: Uninterrupted operation with automatic data protection
- **For Users**: Seamless experience without security interruptions
- **For Security Teams**: Complete audit trail and policy compliance
- **For Compliance**: Data residency requirements automatically enforced

##### 🏗️ **Private Model Configuration**

**Model Safety Attributes** (enhanced in `upstream_api_config`):
- `is_data_safe`: Mark model as safe for processing sensitive data
- `is_default_private_model`: Set as tenant-wide default private model
- `private_model_priority`: Priority ranking (0-100) for private model selection

**Selection Priority Logic**:
1. **Application-Specific**: `private_model_id` in application policy (highest priority)
2. **Tenant Default**: Model with `is_default_private_model = true`
3. **Priority-Based**: Model with highest `private_model_priority` value

##### 📊 **Enhanced Policy Configuration**

**Per-Application Data Leakage Policies**:
```python
# Example: Configure different actions for different risk levels
{
    "application_id": "your-app-id",
    "input_high_risk_action": "block",              # Block high-risk content
    "input_medium_risk_action": "switch_private_model",  # Auto-switch for medium risk
    "input_low_risk_action": "anonymize",           # Anonymize low-risk content
    "output_high_risk_action": "block",
    "output_medium_risk_action": "switch_private_model",
    "output_low_risk_action": "pass",
    "private_model_id": "uuid-of-preferred-private-model"  # Optional override
}
```

**Four Disposal Actions**:

| Action | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `block` | Reject request completely | Critical security violations |
| `switch_private_model` | Route to private/on-prem model | **Enterprise data protection (NEW)** |
| `anonymize` | Replace entities with placeholders | Logging/analytics with masked data |
| `pass` | Allow request, log only | Audit mode, low-risk scenarios |

##### 🌐 **New API Endpoints**

```bash
# Private Model Management
GET  /api/v1/config/private-models              # List available private models
PUT  /api/v1/proxy/models/{id}/safety           # Update model safety attributes

# Application DLP Policy (enhanced)
GET  /api/v1/config/data-leakage-policy         # Get policy with new action fields
PUT  /api/v1/config/data-leakage-policy         # Update policy with private model config
```

                                            ┌─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┐
                                            ↓                         ↓                         ↓
                                         Block                 Switch Model               Anonymize/Pass
                                            ↓                         ↓                         ↓
                                      Return Error           Route to Private         Process & Continue
                                                                  Model
```

#### 📈 Performance Characteristics

- **Model Switch Latency**: < 5ms overhead for routing decision
- **Transparent Switching**: No additional latency visible to end users
- **Parallel Processing**: Entity detection continues to benefit from smart segmentation

#### 🔒 Security & Compliance

- **Data Residency**: Sensitive data automatically stays within designated infrastructure
- **Audit Trail**: All model switches logged for compliance review
- **Policy Enforcement**: Configurable per-application, per-risk-level granularity
- **Zero Trust**: Private models can be air-gapped or on-premise deployments

#### 📚 Documentation

## [4.5.0] - 2025-12-17

### 🔑 Major Feature: Direct Model Access

This release introduces **Direct Model Access**, a privacy-first feature that allows users to directly access backend models (OpenGuardrails-Text, bge-m3, etc.) without guardrails detection, ideal for private deployments and scenarios requiring maximum privacy.

#### 🎯 What's New

**Direct Model Access Benefits:**
- ✅ **Privacy Guarantee**: Message content is NEVER stored in database
- ✅ **Usage-Only Tracking**: Only request count and token usage are recorded for billing
- ✅ **Independent Authentication**: Uses dedicated Model API Key (separate from application keys)
- ✅ **OpenAI-Compatible**: Full OpenAI SDK compatibility for seamless integration
- ✅ **Streaming Support**: Both streaming and non-streaming responses
- ✅ **Usage Analytics**: Query detailed usage statistics by date range

### Added

#### 🔐 **Model API Key Management**

**New Database Schema:**
- `tenants.model_api_key` - Dedicated API key for direct model access (format: `sk-xxai-model-{49 chars}`)
- `model_usage` table - Privacy-preserving usage tracking (no content storage)

**New API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/users/me` - Now returns `model_api_key` field
- `POST /api/v1/users/regenerate-model-api-key` - Regenerate Model API Key

**Frontend Features:**
- Account page now displays Model API Key with copy and regenerate functionality
- Complete usage example code with auto-filled base_url and api_key
- Privacy protection notice explaining data handling
- One-click key regeneration with instant invalidation of old keys

#### 🚀 **Direct Model Access Endpoints**

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /v1/model/chat/completions` - OpenAI-compatible chat completions (streaming & non-streaming)
- `GET /v1/model/usage` - Query usage statistics with date filters

**Supported Models:**
- `OpenGuardrails-Text` - Safety detection model
- `bge-m3` - Text embedding model

**Usage Example:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:5001/v1/model/",
    api_key="sk-xxai-model-YOUR_KEY"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="OpenGuardrails-Text",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

#### 📊 **Privacy-Preserving Usage Tracking**

**What's Tracked:**
- Request count per model per day
- Input/output token counts
- Usage date (daily aggregation)

**What's NOT Tracked:**
- ❌ Message content (prompts and responses)
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ User-Agent strings
- ❌ Any personally identifiable information

### Fixed

- **Model API Key Length**: Fixed key generation to respect 64-character database limit
- **Streaming Response**: Fixed httpx AsyncClient lifecycle in streaming responses
- **Upstream Authentication**: Added missing Authorization header for backend model API calls
- **ORM Model**: Added `model_api_key` field to Tenant model
- **Super Admin Login Issue**: Fixed missing `Tenant` import in `scanner_config_service.py`

### Changed

- **Database Migration**: Auto-generates Model API Keys for all existing tenants
- **Frontend UI**: Enhanced Account page with Model API Key management section
- **Base URL**: Corrected Direct Model Access base_url from `/v1/` to `/v1/model/`

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive `docs/MODEL_API_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md` guide
- Updated `tests/DIRECT_MODEL_ACCESS_GUIDE.md` with complete examples
- Added usage examples for Python, cURL, and streaming scenarios

### Security

- **Key Format**: Model API Keys use cryptographically secure random generation (`secrets` module)
- **Unique Constraint**: Database-level uniqueness for all Model API Keys
- **Immediate Invalidation**: Old keys become invalid instantly upon regeneration
- **Isolated Permissions**: Model API Keys cannot access other platform APIs

## [4.0.0] - 2025-11-04

### 🚀 Major Architecture Update - Multi-Application Management

**Breaking Changes**: This release introduces a major architectural change to support multi-application management within a single tenant account. While existing API keys continue to work (automatically migrated to a default application), the data model has been restructured for better scalability.

#### 🎯 What's New

OpenGuardrails v4.0.0 introduces **Application Management** - a powerful new architecture that allows developers to manage multiple applications within one tenant account, each with completely isolated configurations.

**Use Cases:**
- 🏢 **Enterprise Teams**: Manage different products/services with separate guardrail policies
- 🧪 **Development Workflows**: Maintain separate configs for dev, staging, and production environments
- 👥 **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: Provide isolated guardrail configurations for each customer
- 🔄 **A/B Testing**: Test different safety policies side-by-side

### Added

#### 📱 **Application Management System**
- **New Application Entity**: Introduced `applications` table as the primary isolation boundary
- **Application CRUD**: Full create, read, update, delete operations for applications
- **Application Context Header**: New `X-Application-ID` header for API requests to specify which application to use
- **Default Application**: Automatic creation of "Default Application" for all tenants during migration
- **Application-Scoped API Keys**: Each API key now belongs to a specific application
- **Application Summary**: Real-time protection configuration summary for each application:
  - Risk types enabled count (e.g., 21/21)
  - Ban policy status (enabled/disabled)
  - Sensitivity level (low/medium/high)
  - Data security entities count
  - Blacklist/whitelist counts
  - Knowledge base entries count

#### 🔧 **Configuration Isolation**
All protection configurations are now scoped to the application level:
- ✅ **Risk Type Configuration**: Each application has independent risk category settings
- ✅ **Ban Policy**: Application-specific user banning rules
- ✅ **Data Security Entity Types**: Isolated data leak detection patterns
- ✅ **Blacklists/Whitelists**: Application-scoped keyword filtering
- ✅ **Response Templates**: Custom response templates per application
- ✅ **Knowledge Bases**: Application-specific Q&A knowledge bases
- ✅ **Proxy Configurations**: Proxy settings remain tenant-level (shared across apps)

#### 🗄️ **Database Changes**
- **New Table**: `applications` - Store application metadata
  - `id` (UUID, PK), `tenant_id`, `name`, `description`
  - `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

- **Schema Updates**: Added `application_id` column to:
  - `api_keys` - Link API keys to applications
  - `risk_type_configs` - Application-scoped risk settings
  - `ban_policies` - Application-scoped ban rules
  - `data_security_entity_types` - Application-scoped DLP patterns
  - `blacklists` - Application-scoped blacklists
  - `whitelists` - Application-scoped whitelists
  - `response_templates` - Application-scoped response templates
  - `knowledge_bases` - Application-scoped knowledge bases
  - `detection_results` - Track which application handled each request

- **Migration Scripts**:
  - `011_add_application_management.sql` - Add applications table and columns
  - `012_remove_old_tenant_id_unique_constraints.sql` - Update constraints to use (tenant_id, application_id) instead of just tenant_id

#### 🌐 **API Updates**

**New Application Management Endpoints** (Admin Service - Port 5000):
```
GET    /api/v1/applications                    # List all applications

POST   /api/v1/applications/{app_id}/keys      # Create API key for app
DELETE /api/v1/applications/{app_id}/keys/{key_id}  # Delete API key
PUT    /api/v1/applications/{app_id}/keys/{key_id}/toggle  # Toggle key status
```

**Application Context Header**:
```http
# Specify which application to use for the request
X-Application-ID: 3b9d3c1d-4ecb-4013-9508-a7067c4abf8b
```

**Backward Compatibility**:
- ✅ Existing API keys continue to work (automatically linked to default application)
- ✅ Requests without `X-Application-ID` header use the application linked to the API key
- ✅ All existing APIs support application context

#### 🎨 **Frontend Updates**

**New Application Management Page** (`/platform/config/applications`):
- Create and manage multiple applications
- View protection configuration summary for each app
- Manage application-specific API keys
- Toggle application active status
- View API key usage statistics
- Copy/show/hide API keys with one click

**Updated Configuration Pages**:
All configuration pages now respect the selected application context:
- Risk Type Management
- Ban Policy
- Data Security (DLP)
- Blacklist/Whitelist Management
- Response Templates
- Knowledge Base Management

**New Application Selector Component**:
- Global application context switcher in the header
- Shows current application name
- Quick switch between applications
- Remembers last selected application in localStorage

#### 🔄 **Automatic Migration & Initialization**

**Zero-Downtime Migration**:
- ✅ Automatic creation of "Default Application" for all existing tenants
- ✅ All existing API keys automatically linked to default application
- ✅ All existing configurations copied to default application
- ✅ Unique constraints updated to support multi-application architecture
- ✅ No data loss - all existing data preserved

**New Application Auto-Setup**:
When creating a new application, the system automatically initializes:
1. **Risk Type Config**: All 21 risk types enabled by default
2. **Ban Policy**: Disabled by default (ready to configure)
3. **Data Security Entity Types**: System templates copied and activated
4. **No other configs**: Blacklists, whitelists, templates, knowledge bases start empty

#### 📊 **Application Metrics**

Each application tracks:
- Total API keys (active + inactive)
- Last detection request timestamp
- Total detection requests count
- Risk distribution statistics
- Configuration completeness

### Changed

#### 🔄 **Data Model Restructure**

**Before (v3.x):**
```
Tenant → API Keys
Tenant → Configurations (Risk, Ban, DLP, etc.)
Tenant → Detection Results
```

**After (v4.0):**
```
Tenant → Applications → API Keys
       → Applications → Configurations (Risk, Ban, DLP, etc.)
       → Applications → Detection Results
```

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 Better configuration isolation
- 📈 Easier scaling for enterprise customers
- 🔒 Improved security with application-level access control
- 🧪 Simplified testing and deployment workflows

#### 🔧 **Service Updates**

**Admin Service** (`backend/admin_service.py`):
- Added application management routes
- Updated all config APIs to support application context
- Added application context middleware

**Detection Service** (`backend/detection_service.py`):
- Reads application context from `X-Application-ID` header or API key
- Loads application-specific configurations
- Records application_id in detection results

**Proxy Service** (`backend/proxy_service.py`):
- Supports application context for detection
- Proxy configs remain tenant-level (shared)

#### 📁 **New Files**

**Backend**:
- `backend/routers/applications.py` - Application management routes
- `backend/contexts/ApplicationContext.tsx` - React context for app selection
- `backend/migrations/versions/011_add_application_management.sql` - Migration script
- `backend/migrations/versions/012_remove_old_tenant_id_unique_constraints.sql` - Constraint updates
- `backend/fix_existing_apps.py` - Migration helper script
- `backend/diagnose_app_config.py` - Diagnostic tool

**Frontend**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Config/ApplicationManagement.tsx` - App management UI
- `frontend/src/components/ApplicationSelector/` - App selector component
- `frontend/src/contexts/ApplicationContext.tsx` - Application context provider

### Migration Guide

#### For Existing Deployments

**Automatic Migration** (recommended):
```bash
# Simply restart services - migrations run automatically!
docker compose restart

# Or rebuild and restart
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

The migration will:
1. ✅ Create `applications` table
2. ✅ Add `application_id` columns to all config tables
3. ✅ Create "Default Application" for each tenant
4. ✅ Link all existing API keys to default application
5. ✅ Copy all existing configs to default application
6. ✅ Update unique constraints

**Verify Migration Success**:
```bash
# Check applications table
docker exec openguardrails-postgres psql -U openguardrails -d openguardrails \
  -c "SELECT id, tenant_id, name FROM applications;"

# Check API keys are linked
docker exec openguardrails-postgres psql -U openguardrails -d openguardrails \
  -c "SELECT id, application_id, key FROM api_keys LIMIT 5;"
```

#### For Developers

**Using Application Context in API Calls**:

```python
# Python SDK (will be updated in next SDK release)
from openguardrails import OpenGuardrails

client = OpenGuardrails(
    api_key="sk-xxai-your-key",
    application_id="3b9d3c1d-4ecb-4013-9508-a7067c4abf8b"  # Optional
)

# HTTP API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/v1/guardrails" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-xxai-your-key" \
  -H "X-Application-ID: 3b9d3c1d-4ecb-4013-9508-a7067c4abf8b" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "OpenGuardrails-Text", "messages": [...]}'
```

**Managing Applications via API**:

```python
import requests

# List applications
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/applications",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-jwt-token"}
)

# Create new application
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/applications",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-jwt-token"},
    json={
        "name": "Production App",
        "description": "Production environment guardrails"
    }
)

# Create API key for application
app_id = response.json()["id"]
response = requests.post(
    f"http://localhost:5000/api/v1/applications/{app_id}/keys",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-jwt-token"},
    json={"name": "Production API Key"}
)
```

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**:
- All existing API keys continue to work
- No changes required to existing client code
- `X-Application-ID` header is optional (defaults to API key's application)
- All existing endpoints support application context

⚠️ **Recommended Updates**:
- Update SDKs to latest versions (when released)
- Use `X-Application-ID` header for explicit application selection
- Migrate to application management UI for better organization

### Fixed

- 🐛 Configuration isolation issues when managing multiple environments
- 🐛 API key management limitations for large teams
- 🐛 Difficulty testing different guardrail policies simultaneously
- 🔧 Improved unique constraint handling for multi-application scenarios

### Breaking Changes

**Database Schema**:
- ⚠️ All configuration tables now require `application_id`
- ⚠️ Unique constraints changed from `(tenant_id, name)` to `(tenant_id, application_id, name)`
- ✅ Migration handles these changes automatically

**API Keys**:
- ⚠️ API keys are now application-scoped (one key per application)
- ✅ Existing keys automatically linked to default application
- ✅ Old API keys continue to work without changes

### Technical Details

**Application Initialization**:
```python
# When creating a new application, automatically initialize:
def initialize_application_configs(application_id, tenant_id):
    # 1. Risk Type Config (all 21 types enabled)
    # 2. Ban Policy (disabled, ready to configure)
    # 3. Data Security Entity Types (system templates copied)
```

**Application Context Resolution**:
```
1. Check X-Application-ID header
2. If not present, get application_id from API key
3. Load application-specific configurations
4. Apply application context to all operations
```

**Protection Summary Calculation**:
```python
protection_summary = {
    "risk_types_enabled": 21,      # Count of enabled risk types
    "total_risk_types": 21,        # Total available risk types
    "ban_policy_enabled": False,   # Ban policy status
    "sensitivity_level": "medium", # Sensitivity threshold
    "data_security_entities": 6,   # Active DLP entities
    "blacklist_count": 2,          # Active blacklists
    "whitelist_count": 1,          # Active whitelists
    "knowledge_base_count": 5      # Active KB entries
}
```

  * **Management Service** (port 5000): Admin APIs (low concurrency)
  * **Detection Service** (port 5001): High-concurrency guardrails detection API
  * **Proxy Service** (port 5002): High-concurrency reverse proxy for security gateway
  * Architecture optimization reduced DB connections from 4,800 to 176 (↓96%)

### Added

  * **API Mode**: Developers actively call detection APIs
  * **Gateway Mode**: Transparent reverse proxy with automatic request inspection

* 🎯 **Upstream Model Management**

  * Web UI for configuring upstream models (OpenAI, Claude, local models, etc.)
  * Secure API key management and storage
  * Request forwarding and response proxying
  * User-level model access control

* 🚦 **Smart Proxy Strategy**

  * Input detection: preprocess and filter user requests
  * Output detection: review AI-generated responses
  * Auto-blocking of high-risk content
  * Auto-response templates for safe replacement

* 🐳 **Optimized Docker Architecture**

  * Docker Compose now supports all three services
  * Independent containers for detection, management, and proxy
  * Unified data directory mount and log management
  * Automatic health checks and service discovery

* 📁 **New Files**

  * `backend/proxy_service.py` – Proxy service entry

  * `backend/start_all_services.sh` – Startup script for all three services
  * `backend/stop_all_services.sh` – Shutdown script for all three services
  * `backend/services/proxy_service.py` – Proxy core logic
  * `backend/routers/proxy_api.py` – Proxy API routes
  * `backend/routers/proxy_management.py` – Proxy management routes
  * `frontend/src/pages/Config/ProxyModelManagement.tsx` – Upstream model UI
  * `examples/proxy_usage_demo.py` – Proxy usage example

* 🔌 **Private Deployment Integration** 🆕

  * Supports deep integration with customer systems
  * New config `STORE_DETECTION_RESULTS` to control detection result storage
  * Customers can manage user-level allowlists, blocklists, and templates via API
  * JWT authentication ensures complete data isolation

### Changed

* 🔄 **Architecture Refactoring**

  * Split into three microservices for scalability
  * Detection Service: 32 processes for API detection
  * Management Service: 2 lightweight admin processes
  * Proxy Service: 24 processes for secure gateway
  * Unified log directory under `DATA_DIR`

* 🌐 **API Route Updates**

  * Detection API: `/v1/guardrails` (port 5001)
  * Management API: `/api/v1/*` (port 5000)
  * Proxy API: OpenAI-compatible format (port 5002)
  * New Proxy Management API: `/api/v1/proxy/*`
  * Separate health check endpoints for each service

* 📦 **Deployment Updates**

  * Docker Compose supports independent service containers
  * Added proxy-related environment variables
  * Unified data directory mounts
  * Automated start/stop scripts

* 🔧 **Configuration Enhancements**

  * New proxy configs: `PROXY_PORT`, `PROXY_UVICORN_WORKERS`
  * Improved DB connection pool separation
  * Added upstream model configuration management
  * Supports multiple AI provider integrations

* 📊 **Data Flow Redesign**

  ```
  # API Mode
  Client → Detection Service (5001) → Guardrails Detection → Response

  # Gateway Mode
  Client → Proxy Service (5002) → Input Check → Upstream Model → Output Check → Response

  # Management Mode
  Web Admin → Management Service (5000) → Config Management → Database
  ```

### Fixed

* 🐛 **Database Connection Pool**

  * Resolved DB connection exhaustion under high concurrency
  * Optimized connection pool allocation for three-service setup
