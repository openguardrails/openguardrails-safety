## The Fundamental Difference

Most LLM guardrails ask:

> *"Is this content unsafe?"*

OpenGuardrails asks:

> **"Is this behavior allowed by your enterprise policy at runtime?"**

This is a **fundamental shift** in how we think about AI safety in enterprise contexts.

---

## Content Safety vs Policy Enforcement

### Traditional Content Safety Guardrails

**Focus**: Detecting universally unsafe content

**Typical Categories**:
- Violence
- Hate speech
- Sexual content
- Self-harm
- Illegal activities

**Decision**: Binary safe/unsafe judgment

**Use Case**: Consumer-facing AI products

**Example Tools**:
- OpenAI Moderation API
- Perspective API
- Content filtering services

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Fixed categories
- ❌ No business context
- ❌ One-size-fits-all approach
- ❌ Can't enforce enterprise-specific rules
- ❌ Limited customization

### OpenGuardrails Policy Enforcement

**Focus**: Runtime enforcement of enterprise policies

**Policy Types**:
- Content safety (yes, included)
- **Business constraints**
- **Scope control**
- **Compliance requirements**
- **Brand protection**
- **Data governance**
- **Custom enterprise rules**

**Decision**: Policy-based action (pass/reject/substitute)

**Use Case**: Enterprise AI applications

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ Custom scanners for any policy
- ✅ Business context awareness
- ✅ Configurable per application
- ✅ Enforce ANY enterprise rule
- ✅ Unlimited customization

## Why Enterprises Need Policy Enforcement

### Enterprise AI Has Different Requirements

#### 1. **Scope Control**

**Problem**: AI should only answer questions within its designated scope

**Example**: Customer support chatbot should only help with product issues, not give dating advice

**How it works**:
```python
# Create custom scanner for scope control
{
    "scanner_type": "genai",
    "name": "Customer Support Scope",
    "definition": "This chatbot is for TechProduct support only. Detect off-topic requests including personal advice, entertainment, or unrelated products.",
    "risk_level": "medium_risk"
}
```

**Traditional safety guardrails**: ❌ Can't detect this
**OpenGuardrails**: ✅ Policy-enforced scope control

#### 2. **Brand Protection**

**Problem**: AI shouldn't recommend competitors or make unauthorized commitments

**Example**: Don't mention competitor products, don't promise discounts without approval

**How it works**:
```python
# Competitor mention scanner
{
    "scanner_type": "keyword",
    "name": "Competitor Mentions",
    "keywords": "CompetitorA, CompetitorB, AlternativeProduct",
    "risk_level": "low_risk"
}

# Unauthorized commitment scanner
{
    "scanner_type": "genai",
    "name": "Unauthorized Commitments",
    "definition": "Detect promises of refunds, discounts, or policy exceptions without proper authorization.",
    "risk_level": "high_risk"
}
```

**Traditional safety guardrails**: ❌ Not designed for this
**OpenGuardrails**: ✅ Business policy enforcement

#### 3. **Compliance Requirements**

**Problem**: Industry-specific regulations must be enforced

**Example**: Financial advisors can't give specific investment advice without disclaimers

**How it works**:
```python
# Financial compliance scanner
{
    "scanner_type": "genai",
    "name": "Financial Advice Compliance",
    "definition": "Detect specific investment advice, stock picks, or financial planning that requires licensed advisor disclaimer.",
    "risk_level": "high_risk"
}
```

**Traditional safety guardrails**: ❌ Generic categories only
**OpenGuardrails**: ✅ Industry-specific compliance

#### 4. **Data Governance**

**Problem**: Internal information should never be exposed

**Example**: Project codenames, unreleased features, internal metrics

**How it works**:
```python
# Internal information scanner
{
    "scanner_type": "keyword",
    "name": "Internal Codenames",
    "keywords": "ProjectPhoenix, AlphaRelease, InternalMetric247",
    "risk_level": "high_risk",
    "scan_response": True  # Only check outputs
}
```

**Traditional safety guardrails**: ❌ No concept of proprietary info
**OpenGuardrails**: ✅ Data governance enforcement

#### 5. **Professional Licensing**

**Problem**: AI shouldn't give advice that requires professional licensing

**Example**: Medical diagnosis, legal advice, tax planning

**How it works**:
```python
# Medical advice scanner
{
    "scanner_type": "genai",
    "name": "Medical Diagnosis Prevention",
    "definition": "Detect specific medical diagnoses, treatment recommendations, or prescriptions that require licensed medical professional.",
    "risk_level": "high_risk"
}
```

**Traditional safety guardrails**: ✅ Sometimes included (but as "safety", not "policy")
**OpenGuardrails**: ✅ Policy-based approach with custom definitions

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Define Your Policies

**Exercise**: List all rules your AI must follow

**Categories**:
- [ ] Content safety (universal)
- [ ] Industry compliance (regulations)
- [ ] Business constraints (scope, brand)
- [ ] Data governance (confidentiality)
- [ ] Professional licensing (legal liability)
- [ ] Custom enterprise rules

**Template**:
```markdown
## Policy: [Name]

**Type**: Safety / Compliance / Business
**Severity**: High / Medium / Low
**Applies To**: Prompts / Responses / Both
**Description**: [What behavior to detect]
**Examples**:
  - Positive: [Should be detected]
  - Negative: [Should not be detected]
```

### Step 2: Choose Scanner Types

For each policy, choose implementation:

| Policy Type | Recommended Scanner |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Keyword blocking | Keyword Scanner |
| Pattern matching (emails, IDs) | Regex Scanner |
| Conceptual rules | GenAI Scanner |
| Contextual interpretation | GenAI Scanner |

### Step 3: Create Custom Scanners

```python
from openguardrails import OpenGuardrails

client = OpenGuardrails("your-api-key")

# Create scanner for each business policy
for policy in your_business_policies:
    scanner = client.create_custom_scanner(
        scanner_type=policy.scanner_type,
        name=policy.name,
        definition=policy.definition,
        risk_level=policy.severity,
        scan_prompt=policy.check_input,
        scan_response=policy.check_output
    )
```

### Step 4: Configure Risk Actions

**For each risk level, define action**:

```python
# High Risk → Block immediately
"high_risk": {
    "action": "reject",
    "response_template": "I cannot assist with that request."
}

# Medium Risk → Substitute with safe answer
"medium_risk": {
    "action": "replace",
    "use_knowledge_base": True
}

# Low Risk → Allow but log
"low_risk": {
    "action": "pass",
    "alert": True
}
```

### Step 5: Monitor and Iterate

**Continuous improvement**:
1. Review detection logs
2. Identify false positives/negatives
3. Refine scanner definitions
4. Add new scanners as policies evolve
